This repository contains two machine learning models: one for predicting credit scores based on financial parameters, and another for forecasting future employee counts using data trends.

# Credit Score Prediction Model
This project aims to develop a machine learning pipeline that predicts an individual's credit score category (e.g., Good, Standard, or Poor) based on their financial and behavioral data.
The idea was to simulate a real-world scenario where a company might want to assess a customer's credit risk using available attributes such as account history, loan activity, and personal details.

# Capacity Utilization and Future Prediction
The objective is to predict key employee metrics that enable management to anticipate future workforce trends and make informed strategic decisions. 
My idea was to move beyond just basic data analysis to develop a predictive system that can support HR decision-making. This model is designed to forecast things like employee performance, engagement, and retention. By doing so, it allows for proactive capacity planning, resource optimization, and early identification of employees who might be at risk. 
The machine learning model concurrently predicts the following for each employee: Performance Score, Engagement Survey Rating, and Tenure (Years Expected to Stay).
